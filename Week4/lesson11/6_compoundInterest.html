      <h2>Compound interest</h2>
      <div>
      Your task is to create an tool to calculate investment returns with compound interest.
      The tool should have input fields for
      •	initial investment
      •	monthly contribution
      •	length of time in years
      •	estimated interest rate in percent
      As a result the tool should show how your invesment value grows over the years. Use a table for this. Assume interest is added annually.
      In the result table show the yearly investment value with interest and without interest (total contribution or savings).
      With initial values of 1000 initial investment, 50 monthly contribution, 20 years time and 5 percent inte the table should have the following values:
      Years	Investment Value (5.00%)	Total Contributions
      Year 0	1,000.00			1,000.00
      Year 1	1,650.00			1,600.00
      Year 2	2,332.50			2,200.00
      Year 3	3,049.13			2,800.00
      Year 4	3,801.58			3,400.00
      Year 5	4,591.66			4,000.00
      Year 6	5,421.24			4,600.00
      Year 7	6,292.31			5,200.00
      Year 8	7,206.92			5,800.00
      Year 9	8,167.27			6,400.00
      Year 10	9,175.63			7,000.00
      Year 11	10,234.41			7,600.00
      Year 12	11,346.13			8,200.00
      Year 13	12,513.44			8,800.00
      Year 14	13,739.11			9,400.00
      Year 15	15,026.07			10,000.00
      Year 16	16,377.37			10,600.00
      Year 17	17,796.24			11,200.00
      Year 18	19,286.05			11,800.00
      Year 19	20,850.35			12,400.00
